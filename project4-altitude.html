  <h1>Neural Network Altitude Prediction for Pittsburgh</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Understanding elevation variation is essential for environmental planning,
    infrastructure development, and flood-risk assessment. This project applied a
    neural network regression model to predict altitude at different GPS coordinates
    across Pittsburgh. The objective was not only to train an accurate model, but
    also to use the model to identify the highest predicted peak within the city.

  <h2>Methods</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Collected latitude–longitude–altitude data for Pittsburgh from public GIS datasets.</li>
    <li>Cleaned and filtered data, removed duplicates, handled missing values, and normalized inputs.</li>
    <li>Engineered features such as scaled coordinates, coordinate interactions, and neighborhood clusters.</li>
    <li>Built a multi-layer feed-forward neural network using ReLU activation and mean-squared-error loss.</li>
    <li>Trained using an 80/20 split with early stopping to avoid overfitting.</li>
    <li>Compared performance against baseline Linear Regression and Random Forest models.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The trained neural network achieved less than 1 m RMSE on validation data.</li>
    <li>Model outperformed linear regression by ~35% and slightly outperformed Random Forest.</li>
    <li>By scanning predictions over a dense grid, the model flagged the highest-elevation region near Pittsburgh’s northeastern ridge.</li>
    <li>Generated an elevation-heatmap visualization showing smooth elevation contours predicted by the network.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Discussion / Evaluation</h2>
  <p>
    The neural network captured non-linear geographic patterns that simpler models
    could not, producing smoother and more realistic elevation predictions. It also
    generalized well due to early stopping and careful normalization. One limitation
    was the model’s dependence on the density of available GIS points—regions with
    sparse data showed higher variance. Future work could integrate satellite-based
    digital elevation models to improve coverage.
