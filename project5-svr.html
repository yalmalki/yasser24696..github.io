<h2>Support Vector Regression for Engineering Data</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
This project explores how Support Vector Regression (SVR) can be used to model nonlinear relationships in engineering data.
The goal was to build a regression model that predicts a continuous target variable from multiple input features more accurately
than baseline linear models. Accurate prediction enables faster design iteration and reduces the need for repeated physical testing.
</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>
I cleaned and standardized the dataset, normalized numerical features, and implemented multiple SVR models using scikit-learn.
I tested linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels. Hyperparameters (C, gamma, epsilon) were tuned via grid search with cross-validation.
Baseline models included linear regression and ridge regression.
</p>

<h3>Results / Evaluation</h3>
<p>
The best model was the RBF-SVR, achieving significantly lower MSE and higher R² than linear baselines. Residual analysis showed
that the SVR captured nonlinear relationships that simple regression could not, especially at the extremes of the data range.
</p>

<h3>My Contribution</h3>
<p>
I implemented the entire pipeline: preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and visualization. I analyzed
learning curves, residuals, and performance trade-offs to compare non-linear vs linear methods for engineering data.
