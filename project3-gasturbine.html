  <h1>Gas Turbine Overhaul – Reliability and Performance Improvement</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Reliable gas turbine operation is critical for power plants that supply
    electricity to large communities. Unexpected failures can cause outages,
    expensive emergency repairs, and significant safety risks. This project
    focused on the major overhaul of an industrial gas turbine with the
    objective of restoring performance, extending component life, and reducing
    the risk of unplanned shutdowns.
  </p>

  <h2>Methods</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Participated in a full teardown inspection of turbine hot-gas-path components (blades, vanes, combustion liners).</li>
    <li>Documented and categorized damage mechanisms such as thermal fatigue cracking, erosion, and corrosion.</li>
    <li>Reviewed maintenance history, operating hours, and start-stop cycles to correlate damage with operating conditions.</li>
    <li>Assisted in planning replacement and refurbishment actions (blade replacement, coating renewal, clearances adjustment).</li>
    <li>Supported re-assembly, alignment checks, and post-overhaul test runs, including vibration and exhaust-gas temperature (EGT) monitoring.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Results / Evaluation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Post-overhaul performance tests showed improved turbine efficiency and a healthier EGT margin compared to pre-outage values.</li>
    <li>Critical cracked components were replaced or refurbished, reducing the probability of in-service failure.</li>
    <li>A more detailed inspection log and recommended inspection intervals were delivered to the plant’s maintenance team.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Overall, the overhaul restored safe operating conditions and provided a
    clearer maintenance roadmap for the next operating cycle.

  <h2>Discussion / My Contribution</h2>
  <p>
    As a junior engineer on the overhaul team, I assisted with on-site
    inspections, measurement recording, and damage documentation. I helped
    analyze trends in operating data, prepared summary reports comparing
    pre- and post-overhaul performance, and contributed recommendations on
    inspection intervals and monitoring points. The project gave me practical
    exposure to gas-turbine hardware, field maintenance, and reliability-focused
    decision-making.
