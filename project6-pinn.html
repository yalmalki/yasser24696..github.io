<h2>Physics-Informed Neural Network for Solving Differential Equations</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
This project demonstrates how Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) can solve differential equations by embedding
governing physics directly into the loss function. Instead of learning purely from data, the network is constrained
by the PDE and boundary conditions, making it ideal when physical laws are known but data is limited.
</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>
I implemented a fully-connected neural network and used automatic differentiation to compute the required spatial derivatives.
The loss function consisted of (1) the PDE residual at interior collocation points and (2) penalties for boundary conditions.
The model was trained until both residuals were minimized.
</p>

<h3>Results / Evaluation</h3>
<p>
The PINN produced a smooth solution that closely matched the analytical reference. Because the physics was encoded directly
into the loss function, the model remained stable and accurate even in regions with no training data.
</p>

<h3>My Contribution</h3>
<p>
I designed and implemented the neural network, selected collocation points, defined the PDE residual loss, and validated the
solution against a classical numerical method. I experimented with network depth and collocation density to examine accuracy.
