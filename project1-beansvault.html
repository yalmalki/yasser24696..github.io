    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Many coffee enthusiasts buy high-quality beans but store them using bags or jars
      that allow air, light, and moisture to slowly degrade flavor. BEANSVAULT is a
      smart, airtight container and service that helps users preserve bean quality
      by monitoring freshness and providing simple, guided storage feedback. The
      goal of this project was to design and evaluate a system that extends coffee
      freshness and reduces waste through better storage and clearer user guidance.
    </p>

    <h2>Methods / Design</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Interviewed coffee drinkers about storage habits and pain points.</li>
      <li>Defined requirements for seal quality, durability, usability, and capacity.</li>
      <li>Sketched multiple hardware concepts and selected an airtight, stackable form.</li>
      <li>Outlined IoT architecture using low-power humidity and temperature sensors.</li>
      <li>Designed simple app wireframes showing roast date, freshness timeline, and reminders.</li>
      <li>Created a basic subscription model for scheduled bean deliveries based on usage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Results / Evaluation</h2>
    <p>
      A low-fidelity prototype was created, combining an airtight container with mock
      sensors and a basic freshness dashboard. A short pilot with a few users suggested
      improved aroma retention and clearer guidance about when beans were past their
      ideal window. The results confirmed that combining improved storage with simple
      freshness feedback can meaningfully improve the home brewing experience.
    </p>

    <h2>Discussion / My Contribution</h2>
    <p>
      I led the end-to-end design effort, including problem definition, user research,
      hardware concept design, sensing architecture, and app wireframes. I also
      drafted the subscription model and conducted a small pilot to evaluate the
      solution. Based on user feedback, I recommended next steps such as prototyping
      real electronics, refining the industrial design, and adding predictive models
      to estimate optimal brewing windows.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, this project demonstrates the integration of engineering principles,
      user experience design, and business thinking to create a product with real
      social and practical value.
